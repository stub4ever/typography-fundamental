// 1. Choosing the font-size

// Look at the content what it try to say
// Choose between font-size wisely not to big nor small
// scaling up or down between 1-8 on inspector and find the balance by zoom in & squint your eyes

h1 {
    font-size: 56/16 * 1em;
}

h2 {
    font-size: 30/16 * 1em;
}

h3 {
    font-size: 25/16 * 1em;
}

p {
    font-size: 1.25em;
}

// 2. Choosing the measure
/* If the measure is to short:

    - You feel irritated that the text broke when you built up a comfortable reading speed.

    - Your eyes get tired from bouncing to the left and right rapidly.  */


/* If the measure is to long:

    - You had to turn your head while reading the text

    - You lose concentration midway while reading the line  */

// The measure is easy to write in CSS. One character is approximately 0.5em
// your measure should be between 22.5em (45 characters) and 37.5em (75 characters).

h1 {
    max-width: 13em;
}

h2 {
    max-width: 25em;
}

h3 {
    max-width: 30em;
}

p {
    max-width: 30em; // Between 22.5 and 37.5em
}

// 3. Choosing Leading
// Browsers provide a default leading (of 1.2) thatâ€™s usually too small.
// The ideal leading is anywhere between 1.2 to 1.6 depending on the font-size and measure used.

p {
    line-height: 1.4;
}
